# Encore 

Encore allows scientists to test hypotheses using large scale sequencing data
while hiding many of the complicated technical issues associated with working
on petabyte scale data.  In addition to performing the most common association
tests for single variants and groups of rare variants, Encore enables users to
annotate, share and interact with results.  Access to Encore is controlled by a
white list of users who can upload phenotypes and request analyses.  All
per-variant and per-gene summary statistics are returned.  To maintain
confidentiality of research participant data, individual level data cannot be
downloaded.  By optimizing the most common analyses and providing rich ways to
interact with results, Encore offers an exciting platform to investigate
genetic hypotheses.
